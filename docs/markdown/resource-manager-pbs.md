PBS Notes
=========

Open XDMoD supports PBS including OpenPBS and TORQUE.

Logs Files
----------

The xdmod-shredder `-d`/`--dir` option was designed to work with the
accounting log naming convention used by PBS/TORQUE. If you are not
using the same convention (files are named `YYYYMMDD` corresponding to
the current date), do not use this option.
