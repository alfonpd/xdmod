<p>Scientific Impact metrics are calculated using only publications that XSEDE users have specifically associated with a project using the tools provided by XSEDE User Portal.  While this represents only a subset of a user’s total publications, it is not currently feasible to automatically make the association between a user’s publication and an XSEDE project. </p>

<br>
<ul>
  <b>Metrics By User</b> are calculated  per user using the publications associated with each user<br />
  <b>Metrics  by Organization</b> are calculated per organization  using publications aggregated over all users associated with a particular organization in May 2013. Note that organizational affiliations prior to May 2013 are not currently taken into account.<br />
  <b>Metrics by Project </b> are calculated on a project basis using publications that have been identified as associated with a given project when entered by a user.  Projects may be active or inactive.<br />
